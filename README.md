#CoFee : Conversatoinal Feedback 

In a conversation, feedback is mostly performed through short utterances produced by another participant than the main current speaker. These utterances are among the most frequent in conversational data. They are also considered as crucial communicative tools for achieving coordination in dialogue. They have been the topic of various descriptive studies and often given a central role in applications such as dialogue systems. The present project addresses this issue from a linguistic viewpoint and combines fine-grained corpus analyses of semi- controlled data with formal and statistical modeling.
