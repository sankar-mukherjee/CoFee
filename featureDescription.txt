--- steepness = steepness of the polynomial fit to the F0 curve. 
--- slope = steepness per second
--- NanRatio = ratio between the number of missing F0 values (due to voicelessness) and the number of valid F0 values.
--- f0min = minimum value of all F0 values
--- f0max = maximum value of all F0 values
--- f0stdev = standard deviation of all of all F0 values
--- span = f0max-f0min
--- height = median of the contour
--- duration = endtime of Signal (speaker) - starttime of Signal (speaker)
--- form1 = first Formant
--- form2 = second Formant
--- form3 = third Formant
--- aperiodAV = mean of aperiodicity contour
--- intQ1 = first quartile of intensity: 25% of values are less than that number = 25th percentile
--- intQ2 = second quartile: median of intensity
--- intQ3 = third quartile: 75% of the data is less than that number = 75th percentile
--- intQ1raw = same as above, but for the raw intensity contour (contour not based on word segmentation)
--- intQ2raw = same as above, but for the raw intensity contour (contour not based on word segmentation)
--- intQ3raw = same as above, but for the raw intensity contour (contour not based on word segmentation)
--- pauseBefore = endtime_speaker - endtime_interlocutor % it is questionable what this feature serves for, but I might have needed it at some point
--- SimScoreWord = the similarity score between the F0 contour of the target words of the speaker (target contour) and the F0 contour of the last word of the interlocutor preceding the speaker
--- SimScoreIPU = the similarity score between the target contour and the ast IPU of the interlocutor preceding the speaker
--- TFcomparedWord = True False (is there a word by the interlocutor in the range of 3 seconds before the target word of the target speaker?)
--- TFcomparedIPU = True False (is there an IPU by the interlocutor in the range of 3 seconds ...?)
--- tokenInterl = the word of the interlocutor to which the words of the speaker are compared for 'SimScoreWord'
--- uttInterl = all words of the interlocutor that fall into the 3 seconds range before the target words from the speaker
--- IPUInterl = The IPU to which the target words are compared for 'SimScoreIPU'
